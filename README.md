## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create a chatbot using Smojo AI development tool. This is part of an assignment from chatbot development workshop titled **Build your own GenAI Powered Personal Assistants** organised by Singapore National Libray Board and AI4IMPACT (www.ai4impact.org). AI4IMPACT is a School of Applied AI created by Terra AI (www.terra-ai.sg), that connects students from around the world to learn, collaborate and solve real-world challenges.

## Development Tool Understanding

2. Language of the joke
3. Length of the joke

The replies from users will be composed together with a prompt before sending to GPT to request for creation of joke.
